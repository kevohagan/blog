= Testing out this hubpress thing
:hp-tags: hubpress,github

This morning I saw a tweet from the guys at http://twitter.com/goKarumi[@goKarumi] talking about an web application that got your a blog running on github pages in no time.

This is me trying it out!

And to be honest I am very impressed for the time being!
